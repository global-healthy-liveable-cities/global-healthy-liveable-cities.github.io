The theoretical framework for our policy and spatial indicators for healthy and sustainabl cities was outlined in the [*Lancet Global Health* Series on Urban Design, Transport and Planning](https://www.thelancet.com/series/urban-design-2022).

# Policy indicator analysis
Our [policy checklist](../resources/gohsc-policy-indicator-checklist.xlsx) tool has now been updated to support the [1000 Cities Challenge](https://www.healthysustainablecities.org/1000cities).

For more information on the concepts underlying the tool, see:

# Spatial indicator analysis
Our open source [Global Healthy and Sustainable City Indicators](https://github.com/global-healthy-liveable-cities/global-indicators) software supports users to calculate and report on spatial and policy indicators for healthy and sustainable cities.  

See the directions on [Analysis and Reporting](../software/) for more details.
