Action research is a qualitative research method founded on strong ethical and moral principles concerning the delivery of tangible results from participant-led research which addresses real world problems <sup class='refplus-num'><a href="#ref-stringer-2021">[stringer-2021]</a></sup>.

Stakeholders in the fields of urban planning and policy research and practice who share an interest in the project goals are invited to participate as co-researchers in the planning, design and evaluation of the software implementation through to the formal release of the open source software.

# Why participate?
An increasing majority of the world’s population reside in cities, however inequities of health, wealth and opportunities exacerbated by how we design and manage cities pose challenges not only for individual and population health and wellbeing, but also planetary sustainability.

An international collaborative group of built environment and physical activity researchers, the Global Healthy and Sustainable City Indicators Collaboration, seek to develop a tool to support evaluation and monitoring of policy and spatial indicators to support interventions promoting healthy, sustainable cities in diverse contexts globally.  Following an initial scoping project for 25 cities (https://www.healthysustainablecities.org/publications), a '1000 city challenge' has been proposed (https://www.healthysustainablecities.org/1000cities).  

Feedback gathered from potential users of the software will help guide the design of an open source tool to meet the needs of urban planning and health stakeholders who seek to benchmark and monitor plicy and spatial indicators for healthy and sustainable cities in diverse settings.

# What does it involve?

Stakeholder participants will complete a short survey (linked below) and be engaged through optional monthly online focus group sessions and on-going opportunities for feedback via e-mail or GitHub in progressing the project through three key project phases: 1) Clarifying goals and elicitation of user requirements; 2) modelling a comprehensible and sustainable software architecture that meets the needs of domain experts; 3)  on-going evaluation of prototype software, as stakeholder feature requests are progressively implemented according to consensus on user priorities.  This will be achieved through iteration through cycles of observation, evaluation and implementation (or ‘Look-Think-Act’ <sup class='refplus-num'><a href="#ref-stringer-2021">[stringer-2021]</a></sup>) through to final delivery of the research objectives, as represented in Figure 1 below.

*Figure 1. Software development envisaged through the framework of participatory action research*

The study is anticipated to span 4 months from March 2022 to July 2023, although this may be extended as the criteria for successful realisation of working software for a formal release will be determined through the collaborative action research process.

No prior knowledge of software development is required of participants, whose engagement is predicated on interest and expertise in the intersection of urban planning, health and sustainability and the monitoring and evaluation of policy and spatial indicators to support these goals in specific local contexts.  Participants with an interest in active contribution to coding may do so using the public facing GitHub project page which will be used for development.  Community facing project contribution guidelines will be developed as part of the action research process.

To understand user cohort diversity, basic demographic data will be collected and summarised (e.g. age, sex, professional field(s), years of engagement in professional field(s), qualifications, city and primary languages of practice, prior engagement in the Global Healthy and Sustainable City Indicators Collaboration).  This information will be used to contextualise aggregate feedback in a way that is respectful and professional, and with consent from participants. Participants will have the opportunity to review and clarify any records produced through the project to ensure their feedback and engagement with the project is accurately and fairly represented.

The research is not interested in sensitive or personal details, however participants can request anonymity in records and summaries produced through the course of the research; a random generated identifier will be used in such cases, with identity linkage securely stored. 

# What will the research outputs be?

The primary output is an open source software package (creative work/tool), which will be hosted and maintained on GitHub and RMIT Figshare. A journal article detailing the development process and usage of the software will be published in a Q1 journal, and presented on in at least one conference. Participants who have actively participated as co-researchers will be invited to be included as co-authors, as per the recommendations of the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors. Additional journal articles presenting both cross-sectional and longitudinal analyses conducted using the software for the 1000 city challenge are envisaged as long term outcomes. The outputs arising from the usage of the software will include data, figures and PDF policy reports in multiple languages with broad scope for impact on policy and practice in city planning. The software is envisaged to encourage and facilitate the public dissemination of such research outputs, for example, through streamlining the process of archival in public repositories and indexing with persistent DOI identifiers.

## Monitoring and reporting on urban liveability in diverse global contexts: the 1000 cities challenge

### Plain language description of the proposed project or activity, including the overall aim
An increasing majority of the world’s population reside in cities, however inequities of health, wealth and opportunities exacerbated by how we design and manage cities pose challenges not only for individual and population health and wellbeing, but also planetary sustainability. An international collaborative group of built environment and physical activity researchers seek to develop a tool to support evaluation and monitoring of policy and spatial indicators to support interventions promoting healthy, sustainable cities in diverse contexts globally. Following an initial scoping project for 25 cities (https://www.healthysustainablecities.org/publications), a '1000 city challenge' has been proposed (https://www.healthysustainablecities.org/1000cities).  This project will engage the Global Healthy and Sustainable City Indicators Collaboration network and associated policy makers, planners and interested stakeholders to clarify and realise goals/requirements for a tool to support this endeavour.  This will address the question: How can local neighbourhood liveability be measured at scale to support the needs of diverse stakeholders for monitoring, planning and advocating for sustainable urban environments which support healthy, active lifestyles?

### Rationale
The evaluation of policy and spatial urban indicators at scale is important for city planning, but is a complex undertaking.  It is hypothesised that by guiding users through a detailed planning stage as a precursor to analysis will minimise/overcome barriers to producing quality, well documented indicator research at scale (geographically and longitudinally, for a series of indicators defined and customised according to each software user's needs).
This research seeks to develop software to support an open science approach to planning, calculation and dissemination of spatial urban indicators, supporting urban policy, planning and health practitioners in their actions to create healthier and more sustainable cities.  This is a goal which is closely aligned with NHMRC principles of Research merit and integrity, Justice, Beneficience and Respect. This software could be used by researchers and practitioners to support needs ranging from large scale international collaboration studies to smaller locally focused policy and spatial indicator evaluations.  The tool will be designed to empower users to leverage novel large scale open datasets for local insights, and this has implications for population and planetary health and wellbeing and make these findings accessible in line with FAIR data principles to relevant stakeholders to shape future planning and policy implementation.   An action research-based framework for practitioner-led software design has been conceived drawing on established software engineering and social science research methodologies, comprising three levels: 1.	Identifying and defining goals: what the users/stakeholders want the software to achieve; 2.Defining a model: the software architecture required to achieve the identified goals; 3. Implementation and evaluation of code: quality assurance of code and software functionality.  These three levels will be progressed concurrently through iterative cycles of reflection, implementation and evaluation.  This proposed cyclical approach to software development is founded on established social science and software engineering theories of action research (Stringer, 2021), domain driven design (Evans, 2004 <sup class='refplus-num'><a href="#ref-evans-2003">[evans-2003]</a></sup>) and continuous integration (Evans, 2004 <sup class='refplus-num'><a href="#ref-evans-2003">[evans-2003]</a></sup>; Farley, 2022 <sup class='refplus-num'><a href="#ref-farley-2022">[farley-2022]</a></sup>).  Stakeholders, domain experts with interest in the development and/or use of spatial indicators of urban environments, will be engaged in a practitioner led research programme to determine their software and software-output needs, and to evaluate and refine the implementation of these.  The domain specific language, concepts, and requirements will be used to inform a stable, modern software architecture designed to meet and grow with users’ evolving needs.  The proposed method is underscored by the values and principles formalised in the agile manifesto  (2001) for iterative and feedback driven software design, which has become the dominant paradigm for software development (Farley, 2022 <sup class='refplus-num'><a href="#ref-farley-2022">[farley-2022]</a></sup>).

The benefits for users (of either the software, or the output resources it generates) are the development of software that either meets their specific needs, and addresses issues previously experienced by users of earlier pre-cursors of the software prepared for other projects such that future software users.  This demonstrates respect for volunteers, as it provides them the opportunity to share their previous experiences and articulate what their needs would be in  a software system of this type.  The feedback received will be incorporated in a software development / research cycle, in which the option to participate in successive feedback sessions as issues or features of interest are identified, implemented, and critically evaluated.  This will ensure fitness of purpose for the final open source software product so that it meets its goals of being 1) accessible for its intended users in terms of installation and usage;  2) flexibly configured to address user's research areas of interest (e.g. indicators relating to accessibility, walkability, sustainability, climate change resilience, air pollution, and so forth); 3) generates rigorously documented, accessible and useful resources for dissemination to diverse stakeholders.

### Rational for choice of methodology
An international collaborative group of built environment and physical activity researchers seek to develop a tool to support evaluation and monitoring of policy and spatial indicators to support interventions promoting healthy, sustainable cities in diverse contexts globally.  Stakeholders — researcher/planner/policy maker domain experts with interest in the development and/or use of spatial indicators of urban environments — will be engaged by the research student (a member of the Global Healthy and Sustainable City Indicators Collaboration network study executive) in a practitioner led research programme to determine their software and software-output needs, and to evaluate and refine the implementation of these.  The domain specific language, concepts, and requirements will be used to inform a stable, modern software architecture designed to meet and grow with users’ evolving needs.  The proposed method is underscored by the values and principles formalised in the agile manifesto  (2001) for iterative and feedback driven software design, which has become the dominant paradigm for software development (Farley, 2022 <sup class='refplus-num'><a href="#ref-farley-2022">[farley-2022]</a></sup>).  

A paucity of ethical standards and guidelines in requirement engineering for software development has been noted (Biable, 2022).  Action research is a qualitative research method founded on strong ethical and moral principles concerning the delivery of tangible results from participant-led research which addresses real world problems (Stringer, 2021).    

An action research framework for practitioner-led software design has therefore been conceived drawing on software engineering and social science research methodologies, comprising three levels:
1.	Identifying and defining goals: what the users/stakeholders want the software to achieve
2.	Defining a model: the software architecture required to achieve the identified goals
3.	Implementation and evaluation of code: quality assurance of code and software functionality
These levels are illustrated in Figure 1 which frames agile software development practices from an action research perspective.

The hierarchy of goals-model-code represents a technical gradient from the high level discussions of stakeholder needs to the models for structuring these as a functional and sustainable software project, and the underlying code which is used to implement this.  These three levels will be progressed concurrently through iterative cycles of reflection, implementation and evaluation.  It is envisaged as the project progresses emphasis will transition down through the hierarchy: goals, to models for achieving these, to the code to deliver working software.  

This proposed cyclical approach to software development is founded on established social science and software engineering theories of action research (Stringer, 2021), domain driven design (Evans, 2004 <sup class='refplus-num'><a href="#ref-evans-2003">[evans-2003]</a></sup>) and continuous integration (Evans, 2004 <sup class='refplus-num'><a href="#ref-evans-2003">[evans-2003]</a></sup>; Farley, 2022 <sup class='refplus-num'><a href="#ref-farley-2022">[farley-2022]</a></sup>).  

### Research question
How can local neighbourhood liveability be measured at scale to support the needs of diverse stakeholders for monitoring, planning and advocating for sustainable urban environments which support healthy, active lifestyles?

### Process/es will be used to refine the objectives and design of the research, and how frequently will this be repeated during the project?
Stakeholders will be recruited using purposive sampling through their engagement with the Global Healthy and Sustainable City Indicators Collaboration (GHSCIC) network, or expressions of interest for participation in the 1000 city challenge ( https://www.healthysustainablecities.org/1000cities ), for which a software tool will be designed to facilitate participation.  The author is a member of the study executive conducting this project, as is Billie Giles-Corti his primary supervisor.  The primary stakeholders will be the study executive conducting the project, secondary stakeholders will be those interested in participating in the 1000 cities challenge, and associated stakeholders are those who may have an interest in using the software or its outputs for their own purposes distinct from the 1000 cities challenge.  

Monthly project meetings will be conducted online in 2022 and 2023, along with on-going opportunities for feedback via e-mail and a public-facing project GitHub page.  Cycles of Looking-Thinking-Acting will be undertaken in collaboration with the research participants/practitioners, and can be envisaged as further iterations along a broader spiral of project development through planning, implementation, evaluation (Stringer, 2021) through to final delivery of the research objectives.   Initial engagement will be focused on clarification of goals and elicitation of software requirements.   A software architecture model will be designed reflecting the language and requirements of stakeholders.  This will be progressively implemented according to principles of continuous integration and continuous delivery of working software.  In this way, quality assurance of functionality meeting the needs of stakeholders will be achieved through on-going evaluation and re-factoring (according to the logic of 'looking, thinking, acting') through to final delivery of a working software solution that meets practitioners needs for a tool for monitoring and benchmarking urban neighbourhoods using open data and standard, reproducible methods in diverse contexts.

Data collected will comprise text and video artifacts of engagements between the researchers and participant co-researchers and text summaries of the broader themes and agreed actions identified as arising from these which will guide the course of the software development project.  These summaries will be circulated as cloud documents to participants monthly as required through the course of the project, with subsequent amendment as required.

### Outputs
The primary output is an open source software package (creative work/tool), which will be hosted and maintained on GitHub and RMIT Figshare.  A journal article detailing the development process and usage of the software will be published in a Q1 journal, and presented on in at least one conference.  A conference workshop is anticipated for use of the software for monitoring and reporting on policy and spatial indicators of urban neighbourhoods (e.g. International Conference of Health Policy Statistics).  Additional journal articles presenting both cross-sectional and longitudinal analyses conducted using the software for the 1000 city challenge are envisaged as long term outcomes.  The outputs arising from the usage of the software will include data, figures and PDF policy reports in multiple languages with broad scope for impact on policy and practice in city planning.  The software is envisaged to encourage and facilitate the public dissemination of such research outputs, for example, through streamlining the process of archival in public repositories and indexing with persistent DOI identifiers.   

In addition, this research and its published outputs will contribute towards the research student's PhD studies.

### Opportunities for participant review/edit of responses or contributions prior to analysis or publication
Opportunities for review will be on-going.  Following project meetings, a summary of discussions will be made and circulated using a cloud document accessible by all stakeholders.  This document will provide a log of topics and the evolution of decisions across the course of the project.

### Management of anticicpated ethical issues
Participants will be given the opportunity to request anonomity, although given the practitioner-led nature of this research and the likelihood of research publications arising from this, it is not anticipated that participants will wish to be anonymous.  It is important that participants have the opportunity to review and ensure any representations made of their statements are accurate.  Actions taken in the project will be founded upon group agreement following observation and reflection.  The on-going cycles of observation, reflection and action provide a natural framework for on-going evaluation by participants of both how their inputs are being represented and acted upon.  Participants will be advised that they have the opportunity to check the available records for accuracy, and that additional comments and reflections may be added as required.  This will ensure both transparency and respect for participants' engagement with the project.

### Expected participant population
The expected population will be between 15 and 50, recruited through purposive sampling.  This encompasses members of the study executive of the Global Healthy and Sustainable City Indicators Collaboration network, a collection of established researchers with a mix of domain expertise spanning urban planning and policy analysis, population health, epidemiology, health promotion, and spatial analysis.  These will be the principal stakeholders for whom this tool will be designed, with additional recruitment through the international collaborative network and those who wish to participate in the 1000 city challenge.  This sample frame explains both the elasticity in the sample size, and also why even the smaller number will be sufficient for the purposes of designing a tool which will be useful for a broad audience.

### Selection criteria for participants
Stakeholder-participants will be recruited through purposive sampling according to engagement with the ‘1000 Cities Challenge’ project of the Global Observatory of Healthy and Sustainable Cities, whose needs the software is proposed to meet.  The research student is a member of the study executive conducting this project, as is Billie Giles-Corti his primary supervisor and project CI.  The primary stakeholders will be the study executive conducting the project, secondary stakeholders will be those interested in participating in the 1000 cities challenge or those who previously participated in the initial 25 city study, and associated stakeholders are those who may have an interest in using the software or its outputs for their own purposes distinct from the 1000 cities challenge.  

### Participant groups
There are three core participant groups:  members of the GHICSC study executive; other members of the GHICSC (collaborators in the initial 25 city study); those interested in participating in the 1000 cities challenge; and other users who may be able to make use of a tool for planning, analysing and reporting on policy and spatial indicators without outputs in different formats and languages. 

### participant group requirements
Engagement of participants in attendance of monthly meetings and provision of on-going evaluation and feedback on project goals, software modelling, and implementation will be self-motivated.  There is a desire amongst the GHICSC executive to develop a tool to support broad participation of local urban planning/policy/research experts with enthusiasm for monitoring health- and policy-relevant indicators.  By engaging with the process, participants will ensure the resulting software tool meets their domain-specific expectations and needs.

### Participant characteristics
Participants will be adult professionals, of all genders, from a range of disciplinary backgrounds (e.g. urban planning and policy analysis, population health, epidemiology, health promotion, and spatial analysis).  Some will be research academics (the study executive), while others will be industry based practitioners (e.g. planners, policy makers, urban designers) who may or may not use the software, but who will otherwise be an audience for whom software outputs will target.  The study executive are located in Melbourne, Australia as well as a number of cities in the United States of America (Los Angeles, San Diego, Seattle, St Louis).  The broader collaboration network spans 25 cities across 19 countries and 6 continents.  The 1000 city challenge aims for much broader engagement.  As such, the most important characteristics for diversity are anticipated to be disciplinary and professional backgrounds, as well as geographic-, socio-economic-, and political context of the urban setting in which participants' practice is located.

### participant group numbers
The study executive is comprised of 13 persons (including the research student and his supervisor Principal Investigator co-investigator).   Other than the primary stakeholder group (the GHSCIC study executive), numbers of the other participant groups are not known; some engagement is anticipated beyond the study executive and the study collaborative network itself, but is not essential for successful completion of the project.

### Managing confidentiality
The personal information of participants will be retained in an encrypted file, on RMIT servers, and will be accessible only to the research team.  Due to the professional practice and open source nature of this research project, focused on development of software functionality, it is not envisaged that confidentiality will be a risk or concern of participants; on the contrary, it is anticipated that contributions to the development of the software will wish to be credited, including in associated publications (as appropriate, according to authorship criteria of the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors).  

Prospective participants will be able to opt-in for anonymity when contributing feedback and represented in summary notes should they wish.  For participants requesting anonymity, a generated random identifier will be used with a look up table securely stored along with other personal information in an encrypted location on RMIT servers. Anonymity in this way could be given in written representation and recordings for archival materials generated through the course of the project.  In this way, for example, a participant could share feedback via e-mail which is returned in a summary to the group of participants anonymously.

However, for reasons of accountability, it is not desirable nor practical that participants be anonymous to each other - for example, in the monthly online meetings for those who choose to attend.  These are a professional setting, where professional identifies and their contexts are relevant and sharing of these is a matter of mutual respect and transparency.  This will be made clear to participants in a participant information sheet when invited to participate in the study.  In this way, the project does not desire for participants to be anonymous to each other, and does not foresee any risks in this due to the focus on development of a usable software product to support evidence based urban research.  The commitment to transparency, particularly between participants in the study, helps ensure trust in the final software through honest attribution of shared authorship.

### Working with peopl in other countries

#### Research knowledge of proposed location and processes for acknowledging local cultural values in study design and conduct
Due to the nature of the '1000 cities challenge' for which this tool is being developed, the study welcomes contributions from domain experts for diverse urban settings.  Our prototype 25 city collaborative study provides a framework for acknowledging and accommodating local cultural values and customisation to represent different contexts.  For example, the research student designed a process for collaborative multi-lingual translation of the results of the 25 city study, respecting the distinct requirements for grammar and numerical representation in different languages and locales to ensure that the underlying results were accurately and usefully translated to support local engagement with policy makers to enact change.  The choice of action research for this study was specifically undertaken to formalise the existing collaborative nature of the prototype study as we scale our tools to support broader usage by and for diverse audiences.  This research methodology can help ensure that local cultural values and other contextual factors can be adequately and meaningfully accounted for in the functionality of the software being produced.

#### Consultation with local participant populations and communities
Consultation will arise as part of the action research process itself.  However, to date the research student and project CI are members of the study executive of the Global Healthy and Sustainable City Indicators Collaboration study which prototyped an approach to collaboration with local experts in 25 diverse cities from lower-middle and high income countries internationally.  It is emphasised here that this is purposive sampling from an existing network, with additional self-nomination by professionals to participate based on their interests in engaging with our expanding global study.

#### Arrangements for overseas research
The research will be conducted over e-mail and Microsoft Teams meetings.  While there is scope for additional in-person meetings with research collaborators while on conference travel (to Spain in 2022, and the US in 2023), it is to be emphasised that the Global Healthy and Sustainable City Indicators Collaboration is an existing international research network which the research student and Principal Investigator have been members of (on the study executive) since its inception in 2018.  

#### impact of travel warnings
There is no impact envisaged to the safety of researchers nor participants due to current travel warnings associated with this research.  It will primarily be conducted online.  Although there is scope for incidental in-person meetings (in Spain, Portugal and the US) where these align with existing academic travel plans, these are not core to the study.  There are also no known warnings or factors which should pose a risk should such in person meetings take place.

### Managing RMIT staff relationships
It is possible that RMIT staff could self-nominate as stakeholder participants; where this occurs, the relationship will be as researcher colleagues.  The research student's research supervisors have been listed as co-investigators, and essentially will also be research participants along with the other participant stakeholders.

The existing relationships are that of supervisors and research candidate; the research candidate will lead the research with his co-investigator supervisors largely as equals with other stakeholder participants in the study.  As supervisors, they will have an additional advisory capacity providing the candidate with access to their expertise as required.  Due to the nature of the study, focused on development of a software product, outlining, implementing and evaluating its functionality there is little risk envisaged.  To ensure any risks to reputation are mitigated, the project will be managed in a rigorous and transparent manner.  The supervisors are not obliged to be engaged as participants in the study.  As is usual in a supervisory relationship should a supervisor wish to withdraw from the project, an alternative supervisor will be identified.  This is standard procedure.  However, there is no indication at this stage, that the supervisors will leave the project, even if their circumstances change.  The priority is seeing the project through to its completion.

This research has been funded as part of the research student's work programme and will be conducted during regular work times; online meetings will occur as far as possible during these hours.  However, due to international time zone constraints, it is envisaged that some meetings may be scheduled outside work hours; where this occurs, meeting times that suit all participants will be the priority.

### Recruitment
Recruitment will be undertaken through organisational contacts, researchers' professional networks and self-selection.  Other than the involvement of the existing study executive of the project, it is envisaged that persons interested in participating will self-nominate based on expressiosn of interest lodged at the project website  https://www.healthysustainablecities.org/1000cities .  In addition to the website, recruitment itself will be done via face-to-face interaction, e-mails, snowball sampling and word of mouth.

This project is an expansion of an existing proof of concept study demonstrating feasibility of policy and spatial analysis of urban neighbourhood health and sustainability across 25 diverse cities using open data, collaborating with local experts.  The recruitment will leverage the existing collaboration network, as well as those who express an interest in participating in the challenge following the promotion of this as part of the launch activities of The Lancet Global Health Series on Urban Design, Transport and Health and associated conference presentations in 2022.  Our collaboration study executive includes world-renowned experts in their fields  (urban planning, policy, population health, spatial and urban analysis), and the network alone includes practitioners across 19 countries.  We have also been in discussions with other international organisations who have interest in using our tool.  It is our professional opinion that stakeholders identified through this network, and enthusiastic professionals who contact us will be sufficient to inform the further development of the tool.

#### Recruitment process
Initial contact making may occur via various means (face to face, website, e-mails, snowball sampling, word of mouth), advising of the opportunity to participate in the action research study to co-develop a software tool to support the 1000 City Challenge.  Potential participants who express interest will have their e-mail address recorded; this contact list will be stored securely in an encrypted file on an RMIT server.  Formal recruitment will take place via e-mail in which the 1000 City Challenge will be introduced as an extension of the Global Healthy and Sustainable City-Indicators Collaboration study, and that through this project participants have the opportunity to shape the goals for the software (e.g. which urban indicators, how they are analysed and reported on, and how this can be customised for use in diverse settings and to support needs of local planners, advocates and researchers), and how these are implemented in terms of functionality and user experience.  Potential participants will be advised that while their feedback may be recorded anonymously, anonymity in group conversations cannot be guaranteed and may not desirable due to commitments to transparency of authorship of both the resulting software and an article relating to the participatory research project itself.

Recruitment will occur primarily occur via  e-mails, face-to-face, snowball sampling and word of mouth using the Global Healthy and Sustainable City-Indicators Collaboration network and associated public presentation opportunities, but also via the Global Observatory of Healthy and Sustainable Cities website (https://www.healthysustainablecities.org/1000cities).

Contact with participants for the purposes of recruitment into the study will be made by Carl Higgs via e-mail.  Calls for participation will be via e-mail through the GHSCIC network by members of the study executive, through presentations.  Stakeholders interested in participating as co-researchers will be able to notify the researchers of their interest in participating in the 1000 Cities Challenge (and thus potential interest in participating in this study) via https://www.healthysustainablecities.org/1000cities, in addition to direct correspondence with the researchers via e-mail.

Participants will not be screened.

#### information provided to potential participants during recruitment
Potential participants will be informed about the nature of the project and the nature of their participation through initial contact with the researcher during the recruitment stage, and again via the Participant Information and Consent Form. The PICF describes that consent is voluntary, that invited participants do not have to participate, or that they may opt-out of the research at any time. In order to consent, participants must sign the Consent Form and return this to the researcher. This approach will ensure consent is voluntary. Participants will be able to withdraw from the project at any stage by notifying any member of the research team, whose contact details will be provided in the PICF. If a participant does withdraw they will have the right to have any unprocessed data withdrawn and destroyed, providing it can be reliably identified.

#### Accounting for ethical considerations in recruitment
In terms of recruitment of researchers of other countries, for this particular research activity which seeks to develop an open source tool that is broadly useful, the strength is that our recruitment strategy encourages participation from diverse settings.   The recruitment PICF will describe that written records of contributions may be anonymous if required, although anonymity between participants cannot be guaranteed; the PICF will make clear that agreement with this situation will be a participant consideration when consenting to participate as a co-researcher.  The research will primarily be conducted in English, which the PICF will make clear. However it is desired that through engagement with persons from linguistically diverse backgrounds, the tool may be able to better cater for these audiences (either through its outputs, but possibly also through its user interface).  In this sense, the study's inclusiveness, expressly welcoming contributions from participants from diverse settings and backgrounds as co-researchers, is an ethical consideration which demonstrates respect to local cultural values as per code 4.8.2 of the NHMRC National Statement.

#### Mitigating risk of sensitive information disclosure for participants
To mitigate risk, lists of participants / potential participants and their personal information will be stored in an encrypted file on an RMIT server.  However, due to the non-sensitive subject matter and professional focus of this project, it is not envisaged that such information would pose a risk were it breached.  Notwithstanding that, all efforts will be made to keep it secure.


#### Consent
All participants will be required to provide written informed consent to participate in the research, which is specific to this study.

Potential participants will be informed about the nature of the project and the nature of their participation through initial contact with the researcher during the recruitment stage, and again via the Participant Information and Consent Form. The PICF describes that consent is voluntary, that invited participants do not have to participate, or that they may opt-out of the research at any time. In order to consent, participants must sign the Consent Form and return this to the researcher. This approach will ensure consent is voluntary. Participants will be able to withdraw from the project at any stage by notifying any member of the research team, whose contact details will be provided in the PICF. If a participant does withdraw they will have the right to have any unprocessed data withdrawn and destroyed, providing it can be reliably identified.

Participants will make their own determination about their capacity to give consent.


### Co-researchers
The primary stakeholders will be the study executive of the Global Healthy and Sustainable City Indicators Collaboration, secondary stakeholders will be those interested in participating in the 1000 cities challenge, and associated stakeholders are those who may have an interest in using the software or its outputs for their own purposes distinct from the 1000 cities challenge.  

Recruitment of stakeholder-participants will be via Global Healthy and Sustainable City Indicators Collaboration network and the ‘1000 Cities Challenge’ project of the Global Observatory of Healthy and Sustainable Cities, whose needs the software is proposed to meet.  The research student is a member of the Global Healthy and Sustainable City Indicators Collaboration study executive, as is Billie Giles-Corti his primary supervisor and Principal Investigator.  

### Risks

The development of software, particularly where this involves reliance on third party software libraries, can pose security risks for users, including those co-researchers trialling early versions of software.  This is acknowledged as a minor, but potentially serious risk should measures to not mitigate the risk be implemented.

More broadly, participating in a software development effort means taking responsibility for the quality of the resulting tool and providing assurance that it does what it claims to do.  By participating in the planning and on-going evaluation of the tool, co-researchers who do not request anonymity are publicly aligning their reputations with the quality of the tool: there are benefits for this, in terms of credit for co-authorship and contribution to a scholarly open science endeavour, but also risks if the end product does not meet its intended purposes.

It is standard procedure in complex, applied multidisciplinary research of this nature (e.g. in public health) that co-supervisors are co-investigators on student projects in their role as a supervisor.  They will assist the student to shape the research and provide advice, although - in this case - they may (or may not) participate in the action research itself.  As with all research, supervisors will need to fulfill the requirements of co-authorship to be a co-author of manuscripts that will be led by the candidate.  In terms of risks, it is possible that a supervisor may not agree with the direction of the research, or a paper's direction; and if so, may wish not to be a co-author.  There is no obligation to be involved.  However, the supervisors have been included on the supervisory team in order to provide advice and guidance in their areas of expertise.  Hence, whether they co-author or not is not as important, as assisting the student to conduct the research by providing the candidate with access to their expertise and networks.  There is no reason to believe that this will not be provided in this research project.

One risk to be avoided is any sense of obligation or professional pressure to participate in the study; the researchers do not believe this will be a risk, due to the pre-emptive steps taken to ensure that prospective participants understand that participation is only voluntary, not required nor expected.  In terms of the GHSCIC executive members who have been identified as primary stakeholders, at this stage there is understood to be huge enthusiasm amongst this group to participate because this project will be vital to ensuring the success of the project on which all members have committed to over the past 4 years.

A final risk is the inconvenience of participation, however this is considered minor on two counts: 1) participation in planning, evaluating and providing feedback on the software tool is in the interests of participants, as this ensures the final software meets their own needs; 2) participants are in control of the degree to which they wish to participate, and can choose to opt out of participation at any time.

No other risks to participants are anticipated.

#### Risk mitigation strategies

The use of modern software engineering practices of continuous integration and continuous delivery, in tandem with version control software employing pre-commit code quality checks and security dependency risk analysis will mitigate security risks.  The researchers are aware of the need to manage and minimise security risks, and this awareness in the first instance will guide development for security.  Risks are considered minimal, however, care will be taken to ensure that any credentials -- for example, for creating, managing and accessing databases -- are encrypted and not stored in code or publicly accessible locations.  

All participants will have access to the software code and its full history of revisions, as it is tracked in a public code repository (GitHub). Individual participants will have the choice as to whether they engage directly with the software  through web-application implementations (running like a window onto a server in the cloud), installing the software directly on their local machine (subject to MIT Licence conditions), comment on the code and software features including making recommendations via GitHub, and/or make evaluations and recommendations based on demonstrations and high level summaries of features during meetings.  Participants without backgrounds in open source software development can still make valuable contributions to the project, and those who do not feel comfortable using open source software are not obliged to use it.  However, as above, all software released for use by participants (or anyone else on the internet) will have been subject to an evolving suite of tests relating to functionality, responsiveness, and security as part of the automated software delivery pipeline.

In addition to the above, the choice of study design, engaging with domain expert co-researchers to plan and continuously evaluate the implementation of desired features as working software throughout the project towards a formal software version release is designed to provide quality assurance of working software.  This on-going evaluation with opportunities for feedback and discussion over an extended period will mitigate any reputational risks to co-researchers, who will have the opportunity to ensure the software functions as desired.

In addition, the provision of open source software through a public version control system (GitHub) allows for on-going public feedback and discussion of issues or requested enhancements.  This transparency around development builds trust in the rigour, vision and commitment of the software developers.  Thus, participation is unlikely to damage reputation, and more likely to enhance it as co-researchers will be making a material contribution to knowledge and practice through provision of open source software in line with the vision of open science as endorsed by UNESCO.

The participation information and consent form makes it clear that there is not pressure to participate, professional or otherwise; potential participants are likely to value the benefits they will accrue through formal participation in the action research process, which largely will be formalising an existing productive relationship of multi-disciplinary co-researchers in an on-going collaborative study.

Supervisors have been acknowledged as co-researchers in this project, which recognises their  relationship with the candidate who is leading the research under their guidance.  There is no obligation for the supervisors to participate in the research, or in the authoring of articles which will follow the recommendations of the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors regarding who is to be invited and who will be listed as a research co-author; this will ensure that co-authorship truly reflects genuine and willing intellectual engagement in both the project and its reporting in the literature. Furthermore, as a primary goal of the research is to understand user needs to inform development of software to meet these, the researchers will employ reflexivity on their position as research facilitators to ensure their own perspectives and pre-conceptions do not occlude the perspectives and needs of other co-researcher participants who the resulting software is ultimately intends to serve.

### Benefits

The research will deliver software to support on-going and reproducible monitoring and evaluation of policy and spatial indicators of urban environments for health and sustainability.  This will contribute to an open global atlas, supporting dissemination of data, maps, reports, figures and infographics in multiple languages generated through domain expert users' use of the software to analyse and validate measures for their local cities.  These outputs in multiple formats are designed to be useful for diverse audiences, to maximise impact for positive urban change towards meeting high level Sustainable Development Goals and local policy targets.  In this way, the development of this open source software will have benefits for individual, population and planetary health. Co-benefits include facilitating the creation of longitudinal urban measurements which can be linked with other data for applied research seeking to better understand the impact of urban environments on health, wellbeing or other outcomes.   For participants themselves, their participation helps ensure the software will meet their own needs as stakeholders interested in urban planning and health (researchers, policy makers, planners).

### Overall justification for research

Urban liveability has been recognised as a global priority, underpinning the creation of healthy, sustainable cities. Considered through the lens of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals  (SDGs) the concept broadly reflects an aspiration for cities to be 'inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable' (SDG 11) such that liveable cities promote 'healthy lives and … well-being for all at all ages' (SDG 3). Measurement of policy and spatial indicators of the built and natural environment supports city planning at all levels of government; analysis of their spatial distribution within cities, and impacts on individuals and communities, can be used to inform planning decisions to ensure they are effective and equitable. However, In general, existing frameworks for policy-relevant spatial urban indicators of liveability have limited scope for reproducibility, replicability and generalisability (Liu et al. 2020 <sup class='refplus-num'><a href="#ref-liu-2021">[liu-2021]</a></sup>]; Higgs et al. 2022 <sup class='refplus-num'><a href="#ref-higgs-2022">[higgs-2022]</a></sup>).  This is due to the lack of publication of clear methods or open release of code or software supporting their usage, the reliance on commercially licenced data or data that otherwise may not be generally available in other global contexts, and the over-reliance on standardisation based on cross-sectional observations that impede the core objective of indicators for monitoring progress across time.  This research addresses this existing gap through engagement with domain experts to create knowledge of the requirements of researchers and urban planning/policy practitioners for measuring, evaluating and reporting on policy and spatial indicator to have positive impact in their local contexts, and create open source software that meets these requirements.  

### Data collection

Data collected will comprise text and video artifacts of engagements between the researchers and participant co-researchers and text summaries of the broader themes and agreed actions identified as arising from these which will guide the course of the software development project. These summaries will be circulated as cloud documents to participants monthly as required through the course of the project, with subsequent amendment as required.

The project resources, including summaries from meetings and feedback received through the course of the project, will be collated and offered to participants for review (in addition to on-going opportunities for review through the course of the project).  Participants will have the opportunity to clarify any representations of their engagement, and to request anonymisation.  Once agreement is reached, and assuming it is the will of the research group, the collated resources comprising non-sensitive data comprising annotated excerpts and summaries of professional opinions of participants through out the project and optionally with anonymisation as required, will be publicly archived on an institutional repository (e.g. RMIT Figshare).  It is envisaged that this data will provide a valuable collection of professional considerations of diverse experts in the field of urban planning and health, with regard to their requirements for tools to monitor and intervene upon urban environments.  Any publication of this data will only be undertaken with the authorisation of participants, and representations will be related to professional not personal aspects of individual experts, with specific anonymisation provided as requested.

There is little risk in the collection of feedback from participants on the development of a software tool designed to meet their professional needs as domain experts.  The research is not interested in sensitive or personal details, however participants can request anonymity in records and summaries produced through the course of the research; a random generated identifier will be used in such cases, with identify linkage securely stored.   While basic demographic data will be collected (e.g. age, sex, professional field(s), years of engagement in professional field(s), qualifications, city and primary languages of practice, prior engagement in the Global Healthy and Sustainable City Indicators Collaboration), this will only be used to report a summary of overall research cohort diversity and with approval from participants to contextualise aggregate feedback in a way that is respectful and professional.  Participants will have the opportunity to review and clarify any records produced through the project to ensure their feedback and engagement with the project is accurately and fairly represented, is unlikely to cause harm.

Any personal information of participants (e.g. age, sex, occupation, time in occupation, qualifications) will be stored in encrypted files on RMIT servers or Cloudstor and will only be accessible only to the research team.  Any sensitive data will be destroyed after the 5-year minimum retention period.

The research team are cognisant of the responsibilities afforded them through access to participant co-researchers' professional demographic attributes and any direct correspondence.  The team have all undertaken ethics training, and also commit to critical reflection on how they approach their privileged role in the project (as facilitators, and co-researchers).  Further, de-personalised summaries of group demographics will be shared amongst participants (e.g. interquartile range of ages, percentage female, and range of occupations, time in occupation and highest qualifications), so that no essential information for interpreting the study findings or observations is withheld from participants as the action research study progresses.
